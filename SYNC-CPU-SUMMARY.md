# SyncCPU Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a SyncCPU that runs both CPU1 and CPU2 in parallel, enabling us to detect and handle differences between the two 6502 CPU implementations. This approach provides multiple benefits:

1. Validates both implementations against each other
2. Identifies subtle implementation differences and edge cases
3. Ensures accurate 6502 behavior through dual verification
4. Makes testing more robust against implementation bugs

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Interface Development
- Created a shared CPU interface in `cpu-interface.ts`
- Defined core types (`CPU`, `CPUState`) and methods 
- Made both CPU1 and CPU2 implement this interface
- Added factory methods (`createCPUState`) for consistent state initialization

### 2. SyncCPU Implementation
- Developed a wrapper class that runs both CPU implementations in lockstep
- Compares full CPU state after each instruction execution
- Detects and reports any state divergence between implementations
- Special handling for known implementation differences (JSR/RTS, opcodes)

### 3. CPU2 Improvements
- Added missing logical operations to CPU2:
  - ORA immediate (0x09)
  - AND absolute (0x2D)
  - EOR immediate (0x49)
  - EOR absolute (0x4D)
- Fixed JSR/RTS implementation to be more consistent with CPU1
- Improved error handling for boundary cases

### 4. Code Quality and Safety
- Fixed all TypeScript type errors throughout the codebase
- Improved error handling with proper type checking
- Enhanced test suite to work with the interface
- High test coverage (268 passing tests)

## Challenges Addressed

1. **JSR/RTS Differences**: The most significant difference between implementations is in the JSR/RTS instructions, particularly in how they handle the program counter. We added special handling to tolerate these differences while maintaining synchronization.

2. **Memory Boundary Handling**: We identified and fixed issues with address wrapping at memory boundaries (0xFFFF).

3. **Missing Implementations**: We discovered and implemented several missing logical operations in CPU2.

4. **Type Safety**: We resolved multiple TypeScript type issues, particularly around error handling and CPU state comparison.

## Future Work

1. **Complete Harmonization**: Further align CPU1 and CPU2 implementations, particularly for JSR/RTS instructions.

2. **Missing Opcodes**: Implement any remaining opcodes in CPU2 to achieve full parity with CPU1.

3. **Code Coverage**: Improve test coverage for untested paths (currently at 72.82% functions and 89.55% lines overall).

4. **Performance Optimization**: Analyze and optimize both implementations for performance while maintaining accuracy.

## Benefits of Dual Implementation

Having two parallel implementations provides significant advantages:
- Acts as a cross-verification mechanism
- Reveals subtle bugs and edge cases
- Provides confidence in the correctness of the emulation
- Follows the principle that "two implementations are better than one test suite"

The SyncCPU implementation has already helped identify several discrepancies that were not caught by our extensive test suite, validating the approach of using dual implementations for this emulation project.
